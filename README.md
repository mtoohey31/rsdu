# `rsdu`

Another rust rewrite of `ncdu`.

## Alternatives

For a complete list of alternatives, see the [`ncdu` website](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu). The most similar option is [`dua-cli`](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli), which is also written in Rust, uses a multi-threaded method of traversing directories, and features a tui. It is also currently faster, so it's pretty much better in every way :sweat_smile:.
